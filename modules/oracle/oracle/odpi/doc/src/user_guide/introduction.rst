Introduction to ODPI-C
----------------------

Oracle Database Programming Interface for C (ODPI-C) is an open source library
of C code that simplifies access to Oracle Database for applications written
in C or C++. It is a wrapper over `Oracle Call Interface (OCI)
<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/oci/index.html>`__ that
makes applications and language interfaces easier to develop.

ODPI-C supports basic and advanced features of Oracle Database and Oracle
Client. A complete list of features can be seen
`here <https://oracle.github.io/odpi/>`__.
