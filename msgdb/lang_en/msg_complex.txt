$$COMPLEX$$

In BLOC, complex are imaginary numbers with a $$real$$ and $$imaginary$$ parts,
e.g. ( 2 + 3.i ). The constructor uses the imaginary constant $$ii$$ as base. The
following are valid complex literals in BLOC.

ii , 3 * ii , 2 + 3 * ii , 3/4 * ii - 2/3 , -ii + 1

Real and imaginary parts are decimals with size of double-precision (64bits).
The values beyond its maximum size referred as "inf". Scientific notation is
used as a short representation to express floats having many digits.

Use the $$num( x )$$ function to retrieve the real part.
Use the $$imag( x )$$ or $$abs( x )$$ functions to retrieve the modulus.
Use the $$iphase( x )$$ functions to retrieve theta or phase.
Use the $$iconj( x )$$ functions to retrieve the conjugate (complex).

The following operators can be used with the complex value.

+ , - , * , / , ** , == , !=

The following functions accept the complex value as argument.

exp, log, log10, pow, sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, sinh, cosh, tanh,
round, floor, ceil, abs, imag, iphase, iconj, num, int, isnull
