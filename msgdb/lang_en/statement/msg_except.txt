The keyword $$EXCEPTION$$ marks the beginning of exception processing section,
inside a block BEGIN...END. We could catch user defined exception by RAISE,
or throwable error among $$divide_by_zero$$, $$out_of_range$$.
The keyword $$others$$ allows us to catch any throwable exception.

exception
[ when {exception name} then [statement ...] ...]
[ when others then [statement ...] ]

We can retrieve the catched exception calling the constant $$error$$.
See statement BEGIN, or RAISE.
