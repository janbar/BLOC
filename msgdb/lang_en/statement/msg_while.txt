The $$WHILE$$ statement provides loop flow in execution.
It has a boolean expression associated with it that is evaluated at runtime.
While the result of that evaluation is a 'true' value, then statement after
the LOOP keyword will be executed. If multiple statements follow the LOOP
keyword, they are executed in sequence but only while the expression is true.

while {boolean expression} loop
    [statement ...]
end loop;
