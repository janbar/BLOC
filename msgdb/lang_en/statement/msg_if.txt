The $$IF$$ statement provides conditional control flow in execution.
It has a boolean expression associated with it that is evaluated at runtime.
If the result of that evaluation is a 'true' value, then statements beyond
the THEN keyword will be executed until end delimited by ELSIF or ELSE or
END IF.

if {boolean expression} then [statement ...]
[ elsif {boolean expression} then [statement ...] ...]
[ else [statement ...] ]
end if;
