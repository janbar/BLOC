The $$FORALL$$ statement provides row fetch construct. It defines an iterator
variable that points to current value. Then block of statements after the
LOOP keyword will be executed until last row is reached.
The fetch order could be specified with keywords ASC or DESC.

forall {var} in {table expression} [asc|desc] loop
    [statement ...]
end loop;

Inside the loop, the target table can be modified without care.
