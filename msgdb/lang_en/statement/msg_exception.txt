The keyword $$EXCEPTION$$ marks the beginning of exception processing section,
inside a block BEGIN...END. We could catch user defined exception by RAISE,
or interceptable error among $$DIVIDE_BY_ZERO$$, $$OUT_OF_RANGE$$.
The keyword $$OTHERS$$ allows us to catch any interceptable error.

exception
[ when {exception name} then [statement ...] ...]
[ when others then [statement ...] ]

Inside the clause $$WHEN$$ we can obtain the details of the raised error
by reading the builtin constant $$error$$. It is useful in case $$OTHERS$$.

Note that the interceptable $$OUT_OF_RANGE$$ error occurs when an unfitted
numeric value is assigned. The related error "Index Out of Range" is not
interceptable, and will cause execution to fail regardless.

See statement BEGIN, RAISE, or ERROR.
