The $$FOR$$ statement provides iterator construct. It defines a control variable
that is initialized to an initial value. Then block of statements after the
LOOP keyword will be executed while the specified limit isn't reached. The
control value is incremented or decremented after each iteration. By default
the sequence order is automatic else a constraint could be specified with the
keywords ASC or DESC.

for {var} in {integer expression} to {integer expression}
             [step {integer expression}] [asc|desc] loop
    [statement ...]
end loop;
