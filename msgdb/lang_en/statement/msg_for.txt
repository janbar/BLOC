The $$FOR$$ statement provides iterator construct. It defines a control variable
that is initialized to an initial value. Then block of statements after the
LOOP keyword will be executed while the specified limit isn't reached. The
control value is incremented or decremented after each iteration. The sequence
order is automatic else it could be specified with keywords ASC or DESC.

for {var} in {integer expression} to {integer expression} [asc|desc] loop
    [statement ...]
end loop;
