The $$IMPORT$$ statement is the directive to load an external module.
External module provides new type with features (object). Loading is
performed immediately, so the new type can be used now.

import {module name};
import {encapsulated string containing the library file path};

Using module name will try to load the library 'libbloc_{name}.so'
on UNIX, and 'bloc_{name}.dll' on WINDOWS.
