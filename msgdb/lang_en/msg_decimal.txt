$$DECIMAL$$

In BLOC, decimals are zero, positive or negative real numbers with a fractional
part denoted by the decimal symbol '.' or the scientific notation 'E' or 'e',
e.g. 0.0, 1234.56, -1.55. The followings are valid decimal literals in BLOC.

0.0 , .123 , -1.55, 1.234e9, 1234.5678e-9

Decimals has the maximum size of double-precision (64bits). The value beyond
its maximum size referred as "inf". Scientific notation is used as a short
representation to express floats having many digits.

Use the $$num( x )$$ function to convert string, integer to decimal.

num(456)        >>> decimal 456.0
num("1.23e9")   >>> decimal 1.23E9
num("123.4XYX") >>> decimal 123.4

Use the $$isnum( x )$$ function to validate a number literal.

isnum("XYZ456") >>> boolean false

The following decimal constants are predefined.

$$pi$$, $$ee$$ (euler), and $$phi$$ (golden ratio).
