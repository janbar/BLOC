$$tup$$ returns a new tuple of items, or the null tuple.

tup( [ x [, ...] ] )

Item can be boolean, integer, decimal, string, object, or bytes array.
Nesting and table are not allowed. Tuple is unchangeable, meaning that we
cannot change type, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
The operator '@#' accesses the item at position # [1..n], as shown below.
Expression {TUPLE}@1 returns the value of item at position 1.
Tuple has the method set@#(x) to assign the value x to the item of rank #.
Item type must be qualified. Therefore to assign null you have to use one
of builtin function providing the null type qualified, i.e bool(), int(),
num(), str() or raw().
