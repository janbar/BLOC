$$EXPRESSION$$

An expression is a formula in which operands are linked to each other by the
use of operators to compute a value. An operand can be a function, a variable
or constant. Full expressions are similar to many other high level languages.

$$Mixing types$$
If an integer and a real number take part in the operation, then the integer
will be converted into a real one and the result will be a $$decimal$$ type.

$$Precedence$$
The expression precedence is as follows: (lowest to highest)

  1.  &&, || and xor operators, left associative
  2.  Relational operators, left associative
  3.  bitwise operators, left associative
  4.  shift bit operators, left associative
  5.  + and - operators, left associative
  6.  *, / and % operators, left associative
  7.  unary +/- and ~ operators, nonassociative
      ! operator, nonassociative
  8.  ** operator, right associative
  9.  member . operator, left associative
