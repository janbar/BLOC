$$BYTES$$

In BLOC, bytes is a sequence of byte including zero. The constructor is the
$$raw()$$ function.

raw()        >>> empty bytes
raw(16)      >>> bytes [16] initialized with zero
raw(16, 65)  >>> bytes [16] initialized with 'A'
raw("Hello") >>> bytes [5] initialized with sequence 'H' 'e' 'l' 'l' 'o'

Use the $$count( x )$$ member to retrieve the size of bytes, as shown below.

raw(16).count() >>> integer 16

As bytes is an ordered collection of byte, the sequence uses an index, starting
with zero to fetch a certain item (a byte in case of bytes) from it.

raw(16, 65).at(0) >>> integer 65

Use member $$concat( x )$$ to append bytes, or one byte at end.
Use member $$insert( x , y )$$ to insert bytes, or one byte at index.
Use member $$delete( x )$$ to erase one byte at index.
Use member $$put( x , y )$$ to update one byte at index.

raw("Hello").concat(0x20).concat("world !") >>> bytes[13]
