$$STRING$$

In BLOC, string is a sequence of 8bits characters wrapped inside double quotes.
It could include newline or control sequences. If a string literal requires to
embed double quotes as part of a string then it must be duplicated.

"Hello world !", "This is a ""string""", "please enter a value\b\n"

Embed control sequences can be among \a, \b, \f, \n, \r, \t. The character '\'
escape itself, e.g "\\".

Use the $$strlen( x )$$ function, or the $$count()$$ member to retrieve the
length of a string, as shown below.

strlen("Hello")   >>> integer 5
"Hello".count()   >>> integer 5

A string is an ordered collection of characters. The sequence uses an index,
starting with zero to fetch a certain item (a character in case of a string)
from it.

"Hello".at(4)     >>> integer 111 (ASCII code for 'o')

The following members are usable on variables or a temporary value.

Use member $$concat( x )$$ to append string, or one character at end.
Use member $$insert( x , y )$$ to insert string, or one character at index.
Use member $$delete( x )$$ to erase one character at index.
Use member $$put( x , y )$$ to update one character at index.

str("Hello").concat(0x20).concat("world !")  >>> "Hello world !"
