$$DATA TYPE$$

In BLOC, an expandable list of data types are supported and can be used to load
variables. However built-in operators handle only the internal types.

$$BOOLEAN$$     Logical Boolean
$$INTEGER$$     Signed 64 bits
$$DECIMAL$$     Double precision floating-point number
$$COMPLEX$$     Complex with double precision floating-point parts
$$STRING$$      Character string up to 4GB in size
$$BYTES$$       Binary data up to 4GB in size

In addition we can import many other types from dynamic modules. These types
are objects with specialized features. e.g date, file, etc.

$$OBJECT$$      Imported types from dynamic modules

Scalar and object types can be grouped together within tuple.

$$TUPLE$$       Ordered group of values or objects (row)

Finally, BLOC supports uniform n-dimensional arrays of any type.

$$TABLE$$       n-dimensional uniform array (n < 255)

Type "help {type}" for more information on given type.
