$BDATA TYPE$N

In BLOC, an expandable list of data types are supported and can be used to load
variables. However built-in operators handle only the scalar types.

$BBOOLEAN$N     Logical Boolean
$BINTEGER$N     Signed 8-bytes
$BDECIMAL$N     Double precision floating-point number      
$BSTRING$N      Character string up to 4GB in size
$BBYTES$N       Binary data up to 4GB in size

In addition we can import many other types from dynamic modules. These types
are objects with specialized features. e.g date, file, etc.

$BOBJECT$N      Imported types from dynamic modules 

Scalar and object types can be grouped together within tuple. 

$BTUPLE$N       Ordered group of values or objects (row)

Finally, BLOC supports uniform n-dimensional arrays of any type.

$BTABLE$N       n-dimensional uniform array (n < 255)

Type "help {type}" for more information on given type.
