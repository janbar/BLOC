$BVARIABLE$N

Variables are containers for storing data values. Variables do not need to be
declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have
been set. However in BLOC, variables with a name prefixed by $B$$N have an
immutable type.

a = 1.23; ... a = "hello";       >>> OK
$a = "hello"; ... $a = 10;       >>> ERROR: Type of $A is immutable

If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with
casting.

a = int(3.14), b = num(10), c = str(), d = raw();

$BNames$N
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name.
Rules for BLOC variables are:
    Names must start with a letter, the underscore character, or $B$$N
    Names can only contain characters [ A-z ], [ 0-9 ], [ _ $ ]
    Names are case-insensitive (age, Age and AGE refer to the same variable)
Naming a variable as a reserved keyword can be done using uppercase syntax.

hash = 123;  >>> ERROR: hash is reserved keyword
hAsh = 123;  >>> variable HASH contains integer 123

Type "help type" or "help let" for more information on variable assignment.
