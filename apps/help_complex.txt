$BCOMPLEX$N

In BLOC, complex are imaginary numbers with a $Breal$N and $Bimaginary$N parts,
e.g. ( 2 + 3.i ). The constructor uses the imaginary constant $Bii$N as base. The
following are valid complex literals in BLOC.

ii , 3 * ii , 2 + 3 * ii , 3/4 * ii - 2/3 , -ii + 1

Real and imaginary parts are decimals with size of double-precision (64bits).
The values beyond its maximum size referred as "inf". Scientific notation is
used as a short representation to express floats having many digits.

Use the $Bnum( x )$N function to retrieve the real part.
Use the $Bimag( x )$N or $Babs( x )$N functions to retrieve the modulus.
Use the $Biphase( x )$N functions to retrieve theta or phase.
Use the $Biconj( x )$N functions to retrieve the conjugate (complex).

The following operators can be used with the complex value.

+ , - , * , / , ** , == , !=

The following functions accept the complex value as argument.

exp, log, pow, sin, cos, tan, abs, imag, iphase, iconj, num, int, isnull
