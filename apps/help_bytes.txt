$BBYTES$N

In BLOC, bytes is a sequence of byte including zero. The constructor is the
$Braw()$N function.

raw()        >>> empty bytes
raw(16)      >>> bytes [16] initialized with zero
raw(16, 65)  >>> bytes [16] initialized with 'A'
raw("Hello") >>> bytes [5] initialized with sequence 'H' 'e' 'l' 'l' 'o'

Use the $Bcount( x )$N member to retrieve the size of bytes, as shown below.

raw(16).count() >>> integer 16

As bytes is an ordered collection of byte, the sequence uses an index, starting
with zero to fetch a certain item (a byte in case of bytes) from it.

raw(16, 65).at(0) >>> integer 65

Use member $Bconcat( x )$N to append bytes, or one byte at end.
Use member $Binsert( x , y )$N to insert bytes, or one byte at index.
Use member $Bdelete( x )$N to erase one byte at index.
Use member $Bput( x , y )$N to update one byte at index.

raw("Hello").concat(0x20).concat("world !") >>> bytes[13]
